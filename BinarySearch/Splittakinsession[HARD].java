1. How to Identify Binary Search on Answer Problems
Binary search on answer works well when:
1️⃣ You can define a numeric range [low, high] where the answer lies.
2️⃣ You can efficiently check if a candidate mid is valid.
3️⃣ The validity function is monotonic (if mid = X is valid, then all mid > X are also valid, or vice versa).

✅ Examples of True "Binary Search Over Space" Problems:

Koko Eating Bananas: Checking if K speed can finish in H hours.

Ship Packages Within D Days: Checking if W weight capacity can ship in D days.

Split Array Largest Sum: Checking if a partitioning exists for maxSum.

💡 In these problems, we just test mid and decide left/right movement—no need to explore multiple placements.

🚨 2. Why "Minimum Work Sessions" is NOT a Pure Binary Search Over Space
Here’s why binary search alone doesn't work here:

1️⃣ Answer is not a simple numeric limit (like speed, weight, or max sum).

Instead, the answer is about partitioning tasks into groups optimally.

You don’t just check a single mid value—you need to actually place elements.

2️⃣ The "check function" is NOT simple (requires recursion or DP).

In Koko or Ship Packages, we just summed values and compared to H or D.

Here, to check if k sessions are enough, we must actually try placing elements in bins—this is a backtracking-style problem.

3️⃣ The check function is NOT monotonic (directly).

In Koko, if K=4 works, then K=5,6,... will also work.

Here, if k=4 sessions work, it doesn’t mean k=5 is automatically valid—it depends on the placement of elements.

🚨 This means we CANNOT just binary search and check greedily—we must actually search over subsets of tasks.

🎯 3. How to Identify "Backtracking + Binary Search" Problems
Some problems need both binary search and backtracking/DP to check feasibility.

✅ Common characteristics:

Partitioning a set into groups (not just summing values).

Greedy check doesn’t work because multiple placements are possible.

Valid/Invalid solutions are not strictly monotonic.

📌 Similar Problems Using Backtracking + Binary Search:

Painter’s Partition Problem (Splitting work optimally) → Greedy fails, needs DP.

Partition K Equal Subsets (LC 698) → Needs recursion to check valid partitioning.

🚀 4. Conclusion – How to Decide?
Question Type	Can Be Solved by Binary Search Alone?	Needs Recursion / DP?
Finding a single numeric limit (speed, capacity, max sum)	✅ Yes	❌ No
Partitioning elements into bins or subsets optimally	❌ No	✅ Yes
Greedy checking works directly	✅ Yes	❌ No
We need to explore multiple placements	❌ No	✅ Yes
🚀 Takeaway:

If the problem is about finding a threshold limit (speed, capacity, sum) → Binary Search on Answer works.

If the problem is about placing elements into groups optimally → Binary Search + Backtracking/DP is required.

So, for this problem ("Minimum Work Sessions"), binary search alone won’t work because we must test different ways to place tasks into sessions. That’s why backtracking or DP is required inside the binary search check function.
