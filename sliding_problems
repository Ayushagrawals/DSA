## ‚úÖ Subarray Problem Patterns ‚Äì Master List

To master all **subarray-based questions**, organize them into key categories:

---

### üü© 1. **Fixed Size Sliding Window**  
‚û°Ô∏è Window size is exactly `k`  
‚û°Ô∏è Use simple window of `k` elements and slide it across the array  
‚û°Ô∏è Typically max/min/sum/average in `k` elements  

| Problem | Leetcode | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K | [LC 643](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/) | Sum-based |
| Max Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length | [LC 1456](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-vowels-in-a-substring-of-given-length/) | Vowel count |
| Find All Anagrams in a String | [LC 438](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/) | Anagram detection |
| Permutation in String | [LC 567](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/) | Sliding + hashmap |
| Maximum Average Subarray I | [LC 643](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/) | Just like sum but with average |

---

### üü® 2. **Variable Size Sliding Window / Two Pointer**  
‚û°Ô∏è Window size expands/shrinks dynamically  
‚û°Ô∏è Often used when condition must be satisfied while trying to minimize/maximize window size  

| Problem | Leetcode | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **‚úÖ Corrected** Minimum Size Subarray Sum | [LC 209](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/) | Shrinkable window |
| Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters | [LC 3](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) | HashSet-based |
| Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters | [LC 340](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/) | HashMap + two pointer |
| Subarrays with K Different Integers | [LC 992](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarrays-with-k-different-integers/) | Tricky ‚Äî done with `atMost(K) - atMost(K-1)` |
| Number of Subarrays with Product Less Than K | [LC 713](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-product-less-than-k/) | Multiplicative variant |
| Minimum Window Substring | [LC 76](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/) | Classic two-pointer + hashmap |

---

### üü• 3. **Monotonic Queue / Deque-Based Sliding Window**  
‚û°Ô∏è Use deque to maintain order of elements (max/min) in current window  
‚û°Ô∏è Needed when you want to get **max/min in current window** in `O(1)`  

| Problem | Leetcode | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Sliding Window Maximum | [LC 239](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/) | Deque-based max |
| Sliding Window Minimum | (Custom Variant) | Monotonic deque (increasing) |
| Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K | [LC 862](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-with-sum-at-least-k/) | Use deque + prefix sum |
| Sum of Subarray Minimums | [LC 907](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/) | Monotonic stack variation |
| Maximum of All Subarrays of Size K | [GFG Variant](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sliding-window-maximum-maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k/) | Commonly asked |

---

### üü¶ 4. **Prefix Sum Based Subarray Problems**  
‚û°Ô∏è Great when you're looking for total sum or count across multiple ranges  
‚û°Ô∏è Carries over cumulative values to get constant-time sum lookup  

| Problem | Leetcode | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Subarray Sum Equals K | [LC 560](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/) | Prefix sum + hashmap |
| Continuous Subarray Sum | [LC 523](https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/) | Check modulo over prefix sum |
| Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K | [LC 862](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-with-sum-at-least-k/) | Prefix + Monotonic Queue |
| Number of Subarrays That Sum to Target | [LC 930](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/) | Binary array only |

---

### üü™ 5. **Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm Based (Max Subarray Sum)**  
‚û°Ô∏è Focuses on finding **maximum sum contiguous subarray**  
‚û°Ô∏è Greedy + prefix sum idea

| Problem | Leetcode | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Maximum Subarray | [LC 53](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/) | Classic Kadane‚Äôs |
| Maximum Sum Circular Subarray | [LC 918](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-circular-subarray/) | Wrap around version |

---

### üü´ 6. **Backtracking-Based Subarray Exploration**  
‚û°Ô∏è Usually exponential, avoid unless problem is very constrained  
‚û°Ô∏è Not efficient for long inputs ‚Äî used in unique combinations/subarrays  

| Problem | Leetcode | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| All Subsets / Power Set | [LC 78](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/) | Not truly sliding window |
| Subsets with Duplicates | [LC 90](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/) | Deduping via backtracking |
