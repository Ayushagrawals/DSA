Absolutely! Here’s a curated list of popular and classic **subarray problems** that use the bitwise concepts of **OR**, **AND**, **XOR**, plus related prefix, contribution, or sliding window techniques. These questions often appear in interviews or competitive programming and are great for mastering bitwise subarray patterns.

## Bitwise Subarray Problems List (OR, AND, XOR)

### 1. **Sum of Bitwise OR of All Subarrays**

* Given an array, find the sum of bitwise OR of every subarray.
* Key idea: Contribution technique counting how many subarrays a bit is set in.
* Example: [Bitwise OR subarrays sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-ranges/), [Scaler topic](https://www.scaler.com/topics/bitwise-or-of-all-subarrays/)

### 2. **Sum of Bitwise AND of All Subarrays**

* Find the sum of bitwise AND over all subarrays.
* More challenging due to AND’s restrictive nature. Often solved with stack or monotonic stack to track segments where bits are set.
* Example: [Sum of bitwise AND subarrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-bitwise-and-subarrays/)

### 3. **Count Subarrays with XOR = K**

* Count the number of subarrays whose XOR equals a given value K.
* Uses prefix XOR and hashmap for efficient counting.
* Example: [Count subarrays with XOR K - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-number-subarrays-xor-less-k/)

### 4. **Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array**

* Find two numbers whose XOR is maximum.
* Uses Trie (prefix tree) to efficiently find max XOR pairs.
* Example: [Maximum XOR of two numbers - LeetCode 421](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-of-two-numbers-in-an-array/)

### 5. **Minimum XOR of any Pair in the Array**

* Find pair with minimum XOR value.
* Sort and compare adjacent elements for minimum XOR.
* Example: [Minimum XOR value pair - InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/min-xor-value/)

### 6. **Number of Subarrays with Bitwise OR ≥ K**

* Count or sum subarrays where OR is at least K.
* Uses binary search or two pointers combined with bit checks.

### 7. **Longest Subarray where Bitwise AND is Non-zero**

* Find longest subarray where AND of all elements is > 0 (i.e., all elements share a common bit).
* Use two pointers or segment trees.

### 8. **Subarray with Bitwise XOR Zero**

* Find subarrays whose XOR is zero.
* Related to prefix XOR and hashing.

### 9. **Count Subarrays with Bitwise AND equal to a given value**

* A more specialized problem, usually requires advanced data structures or segment trees.
