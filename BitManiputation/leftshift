//Left shift represented as << it shifts left the value hence it same is increase power by two

//Power of left shift operator
1.set any bit(turn on make it 1)
2. unset any bit
3. check any ith bit
4. to toggle any bit

set ith bit -

eg a=101101
make 3rd bit on 
so we can left shift a varilable
first we can 1<<B and we want to unset we should multiply that bit by 0 so we do is n && ~(1<<B)

Toggle ith bit

as we need to do operation with ith bit of A so will do 1<<B and then we have to invert it so will do or if it's make it will make it 0 and 1
return A^(1<<B);

to unset ith bit -

num = num & ~(1 << i);
