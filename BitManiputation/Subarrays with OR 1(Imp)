 Subarrays with OR 1
//You are given a binary array A of length N where each element is either 0 or 1.

//Your task is to count the number of subarrays where the bitwise OR of all the elements in the subarray is 1.

///Here we are doing is counting wubarray including 0 without 1 so for counting that we can use arithmetic slices concept in which we add continius
//curr and total 
//and we want total with 1 so we did is total subarray - subarray with 0
