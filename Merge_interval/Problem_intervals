Absolutely — **merging overlapping intervals** is a very important and commonly tested pattern in coding interviews.

It forms the foundation for problems involving:

* Timeline merging (like meetings, jobs)
* Range aggregation
* Event processing
* Calendar booking
* Processing logs and memory ranges

## ✅ Master List: Interval Merge Pattern – Categorized by Difficulty

### 🟢 **Easy**

These introduce the concept of overlapping intervals and merging logic.

1. **Insert Interval** – \[Leetcode 57]
   🔁 Insert a new interval and merge overlaps.
   💡 Foundation problem (you just solved this!).
   🎯 Asked in: Google, Microsoft, Amazon

2. **Merge Intervals** – \[Leetcode 56]
   🧠 Given N intervals, merge all overlapping ones.
   🧩 Sort + merge technique
   🎯 Very commonly asked: Amazon, Adobe, Uber

3. **Meeting Rooms** – \[Leetcode 252]
   🕒 Return true if a person can attend all meetings.
   💡 Detect **any** overlaps between intervals
   🎯 Amazon, Facebook

---

### 🟡 **Medium**

Now they build on the merging pattern to apply more logic.

4. **Meeting Rooms II** – \[Leetcode 253]
   🏢 Find the minimum number of meeting rooms required.
   🧠 Think of sweep line or priority queue
   🎯 Asked in: Google, Facebook, Bloomberg

5. **Employee Free Time** – \[Leetcode 759]
   🤝 Given employee schedules (multiple lists of intervals), find common free time.
   💡 Merge all schedules, then find gaps
   🎯 Harder variant of merge + scan
   🎯 Asked in: Google, LinkedIn

6. **Interval List Intersections** – \[Leetcode 986]
   🔁 Find all intersections between two lists of intervals.
   🧠 Two pointers technique
   🎯 Asked in: Amazon, Bloomberg

7. **Non-overlapping Intervals** – \[Leetcode 435]
   ❌ Remove the minimum number of intervals to make the rest non-overlapping
   💡 Greedy with sorting
   🎯 Asked in: Microsoft, Apple

---

### 🔴 **Hard**

These involve clever applications of the merging pattern or more constraints.

8. **Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended** – \[Leetcode 1353]
   📅 Attend max number of non-overlapping events
   🧠 Greedy + Heap
   🎯 Asked in: Google

9. **Remove Covered Intervals** – \[Leetcode 1288]
   🧹 Count intervals that are **not covered** by others
   💡 Sort and careful merge condition
   🎯 Asked in: Amazon

10. **Minimum Interval to Include Each Query** – \[Leetcode 1851]
    ❓ Given intervals and queries, find the smallest interval that includes each query
    💡 Hard — uses heap + sorting
    🎯 Asked in: Google, Facebook

---

## 🧠 When Asked in Interviews:

* 📍 Merge Intervals & Insert Interval are **very common phone screen/onsite questions**.
* 📍 Meeting Rooms variants are often used in **timeline reasoning or resource allocation problems**.
* 📍 Interval Intersections and Free Time questions test **two-pointer merging logic** and are **follow-ups** to basic merging.
* 📍 Hard problems test your ability to **combine interval logic with data structures** like heaps, trees, or custom sorting.
