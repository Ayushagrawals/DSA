Perfect! Here's a well-documented version of your solution that captures the **core logic**, **why sorting by end works**, and **key observations** — ideal for storing in your GitHub for future reference.

```java
// Greedy Approach: Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

// Problem Summary:
// Each balloon is represented as [x_start, x_end], placed along the x-axis.
// An arrow shot at any x will burst all balloons where x_start <= x <= x_end.
// Goal: Burst all balloons with the fewest arrows possible.

class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        // ✅ Step 1: Sort balloons by their ending position (xend)
        // Why? Sorting by end ensures we always shoot the arrow as "late" as possible
        // to hit the current balloon and any overlapping ones after it.
        Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));

        // 🎯 Shoot the first arrow at the end of the first balloon
        int arrows = 1;
        int arrowPos = points[0][1]; // First arrow at xend of first balloon

        // 🔁 Go through the rest of the balloons
        for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
            // 🔍 Check if current balloon overlaps with the last arrow
            if (points[i][0] <= arrowPos) {
                // ✅ Overlaps → already burst by current arrow → do nothing
                continue;
            }

            // ❌ No overlap → needs a new arrow
            // 🎯 Shoot at the end of this new balloon
            arrowPos = points[i][1];
            arrows++;
        }

        return arrows;
    }
}

### 🧠 Key Takeaways to Add in GitHub Notes:

```
🧠 Key Idea: Use a Greedy Strategy
- Sort by xend (ending position), not xstart
- Always shoot an arrow at the end of the current interval
- Skip all balloons that overlap with this arrow
- This ensures each arrow bursts the maximum number of balloons

❓ Why not sort by start?
- Sorting by xstart doesn't help you know when to shoot the arrow
- You may shoot too early and miss overlapping balloons that end sooner
- Sorting by xend ensures you're making the optimal greedy choice every time

💡 Pattern Recognition:
- This is similar to:
  - Activity Selection Problem
  - Meeting Room Scheduling
  - Interval Covering Problems
```
