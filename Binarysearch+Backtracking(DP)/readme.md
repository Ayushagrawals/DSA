"Binary Search + Backtracking/DP" Problems
✅ These require Binary Search, but the feasibility check function needs recursion or DP
✅ Placing elements into subsets optimally is required
✅ Greedy checking fails, so we must try multiple placements

🔹 Problems:

🚀 Minimum Number of Work Sessions to Finish the Tasks (LC 1986) 🔥

🚀 Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets (LC 698) 🔥

🚀 Painter’s Partition Problem (GFG)

🚀 Bin Packing Problem Variants

Why This Categorization Helps
🔥 If you're comfortable with Binary Search on Answer (like Koko & Ship) → Move to Binary Search + Backtracking/DP next.

🔄 If a problem needs "placing items into groups optimally" → It likely belongs in the second category.

🎯 This also helps when practicing for interviews—companies like Google/Walmart might ask problems from both categories.
