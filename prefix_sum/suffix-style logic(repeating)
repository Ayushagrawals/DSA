Absolutely! 🔥 Your reverse-style logic (tracking something from the **right**, and using it when you see a specific element) is **super powerful** in certain types of problems — especially when you're:

> ⚡ Counting how many things **come after** a particular character or number  
> ⚡ Matching pairs or subsequences like "A before G", "buy before sell", etc.

### 🧠 Your Pattern: "Right-to-left suffix-style logic"

You can use this when:
- You're counting **how many items on the right** match a condition
- You're matching **pairs/triples** where order matters (e.g. 'A' before 'G')

### 🔥 Problems where this approach works beautifully:

| # | Problem | Why reverse logic fits |
|--|---------|--------------------------|
| 1 | **Count AG pairs** | ✅ Exactly what you did — track 'G's from right, add on 'A' |
| 2 | **Count pairs (i, j) such that A[i] < A[j] and i < j** | Go right to left, track frequencies |
| 3 | **Count number of substrings that start with a vowel and end with a consonant** | Track suffix consonants |
| 4 | **Count of smaller elements after self** | Reverse + BST / Fenwick Tree |
| 5 | **Trapping Rain Water** | Right max needed — reverse logic helps |
| 6 | **Longest valid parentheses** | Right-to-left + left-to-right pass logic |
| 7 | **Stock Buy & Sell II (Max Profit)** | Track max from the right to sell high |
| 8 | **Number of ways to form pattern “ABC” in string** | Track 'C' from right, then 'B', then 'A' (multi-level suffix counting) |
| 9 | **Find leaders in an array** | An element is a leader if greater than all elements to its right |
| 10 | **Maximum product of two elements such that first is before second** | Track right max while going backward |

---

### 💡 Example: “Leaders in an array”
> Find all elements that are greater than all elements to their right

```java
List<Integer> leaders = new ArrayList<>();
int maxFromRight = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
for (int i = A.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (A[i] > maxFromRight) {
        leaders.add(A[i]);
        maxFromRight = A[i];
    }
}
```

Looks like your `recent` variable, right? Same vibe 👀
