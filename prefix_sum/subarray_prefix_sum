Great! You're building a strong foundation in prefix sum + hash map/set patterns. Here's a **curated list of important remaining questions** related to:

## 🔁 **Prefix Sum + HashMap/Set Based Subarray Problems**

These problems are similar in nature to "Subarray with 0 sum" or "Subarray sum equals k" but test slightly different concepts like counting, length, or element transformation.

---

### ✅ 1. **Longest Subarray with Sum K**

> Given an array, find the length of the longest subarray with sum = K.

* 📌 Use prefix sum + **first occurrence index** in HashMap.
* If `sum - k` is seen, then subarray from that index to current has sum `k`.

---

### ✅ 2. **Count of Subarrays with 0 Sum**

> Count the total number of subarrays that sum to 0.

* 💡 Use prefix sum + hashmap for **frequency**.
* Same idea as Subarray sum equals k, with `k = 0`.

---

### ✅ 3. **Find Subarrays With Equal Number of 0s and 1s**

> Convert all 0s → -1, then reduce it to "subarray with sum 0".

* ⚠️ Trick: Treat 0s as -1s
* Now look for subarrays with sum = 0

🔗 [Leetcode 525](https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-array/)

---

### ✅ 4. **Binary Subarray With Sum**

> Count number of subarrays with sum = k in a binary array.

* 👀 Works exactly like “Subarray Sum Equals K”.
* Input: Binary array + sum = k

🔗 [Leetcode 930](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/)

---

### ✅ 5. **Subarrays With Sum Divisible by K**

> Count number of subarrays whose sum is divisible by `k`.

* Use modulo trick: `prefixSum % k`
* Handle negative mods carefully: `(sum % k + k) % k`

🔗 [Leetcode 974](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/)

---

### ✅ 6. **Minimum Length Subarray with Sum ≥ K**

> Find the shortest subarray with sum ≥ k (not equal).

* ❗ This is a **sliding window + deque** problem (not prefix sum based).
* Works only for positive numbers

🔗 [Leetcode 209](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)

---

### ✅ 7. **Subarray With Equal Number of Even and Odd**

> Replace even → +1, odd → -1
> Then use prefix sum to find subarrays with sum = 0

🔗 GFG variation: [Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-subarray-even-number-elements/)

---

### ✅ 8. **Subarray Sum Closest to 0**

> Find subarray with sum closest to 0.

* Sort prefix sums, then find two closest values.
