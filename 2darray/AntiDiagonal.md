Yes, the **anti-diagonal** pattern is another interesting concept in 2D arrays. Itâ€™s often used when you need to access or manipulate elements that are **diagonally opposite** to the main diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). This is not as commonly used as some other patterns but can still be helpful in certain problems.

### âœ… **Anti-Diagonal Pattern** â€“ How It Works

The **anti-diagonal** elements in a matrix are the ones that lie along the diagonal that starts from the **top-right corner** and extends to the **bottom-left corner**. For example, in a **3x3 matrix**, the anti-diagonal elements are:

```
Matrix A (3x3):
{ { 1, 2, 3 },
  { 4, 5, 6 },
  { 7, 8, 9 } }

Anti-diagonal elements are: 
{ 3, 5, 7 }
```

Here, the anti-diagonal consists of the elements `[3, 5, 7]`.

### ðŸ§  **Pattern & Usage**
- **Indexing Anti-Diagonal:** To access or modify elements on the anti-diagonal:
  - The **row index** and **column index** follow a specific pattern: 
    - `i-th row` and `(n-1-i)-th column` for a `n x n` matrix.
    - For example, in a 3x3 matrix, the indices for the anti-diagonal elements are `(0, 2)`, `(1, 1)`, `(2, 0)`.

### âœ… **Common Problems Where Anti-Diagonal Pattern Is Used**

1. **Anti-Diagonal Traversal**
   - **Problem:** Given a matrix, print or manipulate elements along the anti-diagonal.
   - **Approach:** You can use the pattern to access and process all anti-diagonal elements. Itâ€™s often done in grid traversal problems where the goal is to work with diagonals.

2. **Matrix Rotation (Anti-Diagonal)** 
   - **Problem:** Rotate a matrix by 90 degrees (clockwise or counter-clockwise) in place.
   - **Approach:** This might not be a "direct anti-diagonal manipulation," but when rotating a matrix, you need to carefully account for both the main diagonal and anti-diagonal when transforming the matrix. 

3. **Matrix Search**
   - **Problem:** Search for a target value in a 2D matrix where rows and columns are sorted (like in **LeetCode 74**).
   - **Approach:** Though this problem isn't exactly about anti-diagonals, you can apply diagonal traversal techniques, including anti-diagonal ones, for search optimizations when elements are structured along diagonals.

4. **Diagonal Difference (LeetCode 118)**
   - **Problem:** Calculate the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's diagonals. 
   - **Approach:** You sum the elements of the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal and then find the absolute difference.

   **For example:**
   ```
   { { 1, 2, 3 },
     { 4, 5, 6 },
     { 7, 8, 9 } }
   
   Main diagonal sum: 1 + 5 + 9 = 15
   Anti-diagonal sum: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
   Difference: |15 - 15| = 0
   ```

5. **Diagonal Traversal of a Matrix (LeetCode 498)**
   - **Problem:** Given a matrix, traverse and print the diagonals in a specific order. The traversal needs to consider both diagonals.
   - **Approach:** You need to handle both main diagonals and anti-diagonals to correctly print elements from top to bottom and left to right.

6. **Anti-Diagonal Matrix Sum**
   - **Problem:** Given a matrix, calculate the sum of the anti-diagonal elements.
   - **Approach:** Traverse each row and select the corresponding element for the anti-diagonal column `(n-1-i)` where `i` is the row index.

### ðŸ§  **How to Recognize When to Use the Anti-Diagonal Pattern**

- **When the problem involves diagonals:** Specifically when you need to **access or modify diagonal elements** (usually anti-diagonal or main diagonal).
- **When working with square matrices (n x n):** The concept of anti-diagonal is generally used in square matrices, so when you see an `n x n` matrix problem, check if the anti-diagonal elements are important.
- **When the problem asks for a traversal or specific indexing in a diagonal pattern.**
