Yes — **this is a well-known interview pattern**, and MANY questions are based on this exact idea.

This pattern is called:

# ⭐ **Staircase Search Pattern**

(or "Top-Right Pointer Pattern" / “Row & Column Sorted Matrix Pattern”)

Whenever a matrix is **sorted row-wise AND column-wise**, this pattern applies.

---

# ✅ Core conditions for this pattern

You can use the staircase pattern when:

* Rows are sorted
* Columns are sorted
* (Usually both in non-decreasing order)

Then you can start at **top-right** or **bottom-left** and move:

* **Left** if value is too big
* **Down** if value is too small

# 📚 Common Questions Based on This Pattern

Here is a list of classic interview questions that use this exact trick:

---

## **🟩 1. Search in a row-column sorted matrix**

Find target in matrix where each row & column is sorted.
**Use staircase search** → O(N + M).

---

## **🟩 2. Count elements ≤ X in sorted matrix**

Very common in finding the **median of a matrix**.
Also uses the same staircase traversal.

---

## **🟩 3. Row with maximum 1s (your current question)**

Use exactly the same trick → O(N + M).

---

## **🟩 4. Find the k-th smallest element in sorted matrix**

Also uses counting elements ≤ mid using staircase scan.

---

## **🟩 5. Find smallest element >= target**

Two-pointer movement from top-right.

---

## **🟩 6. Searching for a peak in 2D sorted matrix**

Some companies also adapt it from this idea.

---

## **🟩 7. Find number of negative numbers in sorted matrix**

ZEROes then NEGATIVE numbers → similar movement work.

---

# 🎯 Key idea behind all of them:

**Once you move left or down, you NEVER go back.
So total moves = rows + columns.**

That’s why these problems all become **O(N + M)** instead of **O(N²)**.

---

# 🧠 How to recognize the pattern instantly in interviews?

Ask yourself:

### “Is the matrix sorted row-wise AND column-wise?”

If **yes**, immediately think:

👉 “Start at top-right and staircase-walk.”

### “Am I trying to count something or find something in each row?”

If rows are sorted AND columns sorted → **use staircase**.
