TO CALCULATE SUBMATRIX SUM TWO POINT SHOULD BE IN MIND FOR CREATING PREFIX MATRIX AND FOR QUERYIES-

Absolutely! Let's break down these **two related but separate steps**:

---

## ✅ **STEP 1: Building the Prefix Sum Matrix**

You want to build a `prefix[i][j]` that holds the **sum of elements from (0,0) to (i,j)** — i.e., the rectangle from the top-left corner to the current cell.

### Formula:

```java
prefix[i][j] = A[i][j]
             + prefix[i-1][j]    // sum of above
             + prefix[i][j-1]    // sum of left
             - prefix[i-1][j-1]; // subtract the overlap (top-left)
```

### Why subtract `prefix[i-1][j-1]`?

Because both `prefix[i-1][j]` (above) and `prefix[i][j-1]` (left) **include the top-left corner area** (`prefix[i-1][j-1]`). So it's **added twice**, and we subtract it **once** to fix the double-counting.

---

### Example:

Matrix A:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

Let’s compute `prefix[1][1]`, which should be the sum of:

```
1 2
4 5
```

Expected sum = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 12

Using the formula:

```
prefix[1][1] = A[1][1]         = 5
             + prefix[0][1]    = 3  (1+2)
             + prefix[1][0]    = 5  (1+4)
             - prefix[0][0]    = 1
           = 5 + 3 + 5 - 1 = 12 ✔️
```

## ✅ **STEP 2: Querying the Sum of a Submatrix**

You are given a top-left `(r1, c1)` and bottom-right `(r2, c2)` of a submatrix.
You use the full prefix sum matrix to quickly get the sum of only that rectangle.

### Formula:

```java
sum = prefix[r2][c2]
    - prefix[r1-1][c2]   // remove above
    - prefix[r2][c1-1]   // remove left
    + prefix[r1-1][c1-1] // add overlap back
```

### Why subtract above and left?

You started with the full area from `(0,0)` to `(r2,c2)` — that’s **too big**.
So you remove:

* The rectangle **above** your submatrix.
* The rectangle **left** of your submatrix.

### Why add back `prefix[r1-1][c1-1]`?

Because the above and left areas **overlap** in the **top-left corner**, and we **subtracted that part twice**, so we **add it back once**.

---

### Summary of both steps:

| Step              | What you’re doing                                  | Why subtract `prefix[i-1][j-1]`?                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Building Prefix | Avoid **double-counting** area during construction | Because it's **added twice** by top and left      |
| ✅ Querying Sum    | Avoid **overcounting** when extracting a submatrix | Because it's **subtracted twice** by above & left |
