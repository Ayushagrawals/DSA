Absolutely! Here's a list of **interview and competitive coding questions** that are **based on submatrix prefix sum** or closely related to the concept. These are excellent for strengthening your grasp on the technique.

## ðŸ”¥ **Core Submatrix Prefix Sum Problems**

### 1. **Submatrix Sum Queries (You just solved this one)**

* **Type**: Multiple submatrix sum queries
* **Goal**: Answer Q queries efficiently using prefix sum.
* **What it tests**: Efficient O(1) submatrix sum extraction after O(NÃ—M) preprocessing.

---

### 2. **Maximum Sum Submatrix of Size kÃ—k**

* **Type**: Sliding window over prefix sums
* **Goal**: Given a matrix, find the kÃ—k submatrix with the maximum sum.
* **Approach**: Use prefix sum to compute each kÃ—k region in O(1) time.
* **Follow-up**: Handle very large matrices efficiently.

---

### 3. **Maximum Sum Rectangle in a 2D Matrix**

* **Type**: Kadaneâ€™s algorithm + prefix sum
* **Goal**: Find the rectangle (of any size) with the maximum sum.
* **Approach**:

  * Compress 2D to 1D using row pairs and apply Kadaneâ€™s algo.
  * Often used in interviews at Amazon, Google.

### 4. **Count Submatrices with Sum Equal to Target**

* **Platform**: Leetcode [Problem #1074](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-submatrices-that-sum-to-target/)
* **Goal**: Count the number of submatrices that sum to a given target.
* **Approach**: Use prefix sum + hashmap + variation of subarray sum equals k.
* **Difficulty**: Hard but elegant.

---

### 5. **Sum of All Submatrices**

* **Goal**: Return the sum of **all possible submatrices** in a matrix.
* **Trick**: Each element contributes to many submatrices â†’ use combinatorics to find how many times each element is counted.

---

### 6. **Find the Submatrix with Maximum Average**

* **Variation**: Like max sum, but return average.
* **Approach**: Use prefix sum to avoid recalculating region sums.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Real-World Analogies or Applications

* **Heatmaps / Image Processing**: Sum of brightness/pixels in a region.
* **Game Dev / Grid-Based Logic**: Total resource value in a zone.
* **Geo Heat Grids**: Total temperature/rainfall in a sub-region.
