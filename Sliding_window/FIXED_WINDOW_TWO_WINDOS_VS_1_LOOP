Perfect! You‚Äôre ready for full clarity.

## ‚úÖ **When to explicitly create the first window in fixed-size sliding window problems:**

You **need to explicitly create the first window** when the logic requires:
- **Full knowledge of `B` elements**
- Like: computing a **sum, max, min, frequency map, average** etc.

You **do not need to create the first window manually** when:
- The operation can be **built incrementally**
- You‚Äôre maintaining **presence/absence**, like with `Set` or `Map`, where the window size is enforced on-the-fly (e.g. remove when `i >= B`).

## üîç Golden Rule

| Operation Type       | Need First Window? | Why? |
|----------------------|--------------------|------|
| Sum / Max / Min      | ‚úÖ Yes             | Requires full window to begin comparison |
| Count of occurrences | ‚úÖ Yes             | Need initial window to initialize counts |
| Uniqueness / Duplicates check with Set/Map | ‚ùå No | Window can be enforced during traversal (`remove(nums[i - B])`) |
