# üîç Sliding Window Technique ‚Äî When to Use & When Not

Sliding Window is a powerful technique for subarray and substring problems ‚Äî but it doesn't work **everywhere**.

---

## ‚úÖ When Sliding Window **Works Well**

Use sliding window when:

- You're working with **contiguous subarrays or substrings**
- The array contains **only positive numbers**
- You can **move left/right pointers** to grow or shrink the window based on a condition
- The condition you're checking is **monotonic** (e.g., increasing/decreasing)

---

## ‚ùå When Sliding Window **Fails**

Avoid sliding window when:

- The array contains **negative numbers**, and you're checking for **sum** or **product** conditions
- You need to **count all subarrays**, not just find the max/min/length
- The problem is about **non-contiguous subsequences**
- The subarray condition requires **complex global tracking** (not local window decisions)
- You're doing **range-based counting**, which requires **prefix sums**, **binary search**, or **segment trees**

## üí° Sliding Window Checklist

‚úÖ Is it about **contiguous subarrays or substrings**?  
‚úÖ Are all elements **positive or monotonic**?  
‚úÖ Can you adjust the window using **two pointers**?  
‚ùå Does it involve **negative values** in sum/product conditions?  
‚ùå Are you asked to **count** or handle **non-contiguous elements**?
