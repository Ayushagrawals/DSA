Great question! ðŸŒŸ Yes â€” we can **categorize sliding window problems** into different types based on:

- Whether the window size is **fixed or dynamic** âœ…
- What **data structure** is used: **map**, **set**, **array**, **deque**, etc.
- What the **goal** is: max length, min length, count, index, etc.

---

### âœ… 1. **Fixed Size Sliding Window**
- **Window size `k` is known**, and you slide it across the array/string.
- Usually uses **arrays** or **queues**.
  
#### ðŸ§  Common Goals:
- Max/Min sum
- Average of window
- Max/Min value in window (with deque)

#### ðŸ”¥ Examples:
- **LC 239**: Sliding Window Maximum *(deque)*
- **LC 643**: Maximum Average Subarray I
- **LC 480**: Sliding Window Median *(multiset or heaps)*

---

### âœ… 2. **Dynamic Size Sliding Window**
- Window size varies depending on a condition.
- Usually involves **map**, **set**, or **frequency arrays**.

#### ðŸ§  Common Goals:
- Longest substring with at most K distinct characters
- Longest substring without repeating characters
- Minimum window containing all characters

#### ðŸ”¥ Examples:
- **LC 3**: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters *(set/map)*
- **LC 76**: Minimum Window Substring *(map + two maps technique)*
- **LC 159**: Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters *(this one!)*
- **LC 340**: Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters *(generalized version)*

---

### âœ… 3. **Count-Based Sliding Window**
- You count how many windows satisfy a certain property.

#### ðŸ”¥ Examples:
- **LC 567**: Permutation in String
- **LC 438**: Find All Anagrams in a String
  - Use **char frequency map/array** + count of matches

---

### âœ… 4. **Two Pointers Variant (Like Sliding Window but With Conditions)**
- A form of sliding window often used for sorted arrays or specific problems like subarrays/substrings with sums or products.

#### ðŸ”¥ Examples:
- **LC 992**: Subarrays with K Different Integers *(two-pointer + map)*
- **LC 1248**: Count Number of Nice Subarrays

---

### âœ… 5. **Deque-Based Sliding Window**
- Used for tracking min/max in O(1) inside the window

#### ðŸ”¥ Example:
- **LC 239**: Sliding Window Maximum

---

### âœ… 6. **Prefix Sum + Sliding Window Hybrid**
- Especially when dealing with **sums** over subarrays
- Sometimes better than a brute sliding window
