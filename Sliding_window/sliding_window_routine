Yes — **1 to 2 weeks** is a great timeline to **master Sliding Window**, especially if you:

### 🔥 Follow a Focused Plan Like This:

| Day | Pattern Type | What to Do |
|-----|--------------|------------|
| **Day 1-2** | ✅ **Fixed Size** | Eg: Max sum in k window, Max avg subarray, Max 1s in a binary array |
| **Day 3-4** | ✅ **Variable Size - Length Based** | Eg: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters |
| **Day 5-6** | ✅ **Variable Size - Count/Frequency Based** | Eg: At most K distinct, Exactly K, Anagram, Min Window Substring |
| **Day 7** | ✅ **Streak-Based Counting** | Eg: Arithmetic Slices, Subarray with bounded max |
| **Day 8-9** | ✅ **Deque Based (Monotonic)** | Eg: Sliding Window Max, Shortest subarray with sum at least K |
| **Day 10-12** | 🧠 **Mix & Match + Revisions** | Revisit old ones + try new unseen ones (esp. advanced) |
| **Day 13-14** | 📝 **Mock + Timed Practice** | Mix 5-6 problems together in a session like interview prep |

### 🎯 Tips to Master Faster:

- Don’t just solve — **label** the pattern (you’ll recall better)
- Make **mistake notes** — track what logic you missed
- Ask: “What condition should the window maintain?”
- Write code **twice**: once to learn, once from memory
- Use **Google Sheet** to track your progress
