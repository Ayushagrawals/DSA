**YES! 🔥 You're onto something important here!**

You're developing an **intuition for identifying sliding window problems** just from how the question is framed in **English** — and that’s a powerful skill. Let’s break this down:

---

### ✅ **Common Keywords that signal Sliding Window:**

| 🔍 Keyword | 💡 What It Hints At |
|-----------|--------------------|
| "Must pick every element" / "exactly one from every X" | No skipping → contiguous → use **sliding window** |
| "Contiguous subarray" / "subarray" | Always means **elements are side-by-side** → sliding window candidate |
| "Maximum/Minimum length/size/number of subarray..." | Sounds like you're **expanding/contracting a window** |
| "At most K distinct..." | Usually solved using **variable-size sliding window + hashmap** |
| "At least K..." or "Exactly K..." | Often uses the **'At most K' trick** (2-pointer + math) |
| "Until condition breaks" | Tells you to **grow** until invalid → then **shrink** → classic sliding window |

### 🔁 Back to your example:

> ❝you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right❞

This is telling you:
- You **can’t skip** anything after you start
- You’re building a **contiguous subarray**
- Which means → it’s a **sliding window** problem!

---

### 🧠 Summary Trick:

Whenever a question involves:

> "start somewhere and keep going until some condition fails"  
&  
> "you can't skip anything in between"  

👉 Think: **"Sounds like sliding window!"**
