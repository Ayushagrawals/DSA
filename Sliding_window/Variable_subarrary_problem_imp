Absolutely! ðŸ”¥ Here's a focused list of **Variable-Size Sliding Window Problems** â€” all **subarray-based**, using **two pointers** to dynamically grow/shrink the window based on constraints.

## ðŸ§  What Makes It "Variable"?
- You donâ€™t fix the window to a size `k`.
- Instead, you grow the window (`end++`) and shrink from the left (`start++`) when some **condition is violated** (product, sum, distinct count, etc.)

## âœ… Must-Do Variable Sliding Window Problems (Subarray Focus)

| # | Problem Title                                                                 | Key Concept                                | Technique          |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**                          | No repeats allowed                          | HashSet / HashMap  |
| 2 | **Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters**                    | â‰¤ K unique characters                       | HashMap + Count    |
| 3 | **Subarrays with At Most K Distinct Integers**                              | Count subarrays with â‰¤ K unique elements    | HashMap + Shrink   |
| 4 | **Count Substrings with Exactly K Distinct Characters**                     | Exactly K distinct â†’ (atMostK - atMostK-1)  | Trick + HashMap    |
| 5 | **Number of Subarrays with Product Less Than K**                            | Product < K                                 | Two pointers       |
| 6 | **Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length (K)**             | Fixed size but you may confuse it as var    | Set + Count        |
| 7 | **Minimum Size Subarray Sum**                                               | Smallest subarray with sum â‰¥ target         | Sum + Shrink       |
| 8 | **Max Consecutive Ones III**                                                | Flip at most `k` zeros                      | Count 0â€™s + Shrink |
| 9 | **Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element**                      | One delete allowed â†’ careful shrinking      | Count 0â€™s          |
| 10| **Sliding Window Maximum** (can also be seen as variable by logic pattern)  | Track max using deque                       | Monotonic deque    |

## ðŸ§ª Difference from Fixed Sliding Window:
| Fixed Window                               | Variable Window                                 |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Window size = constant (like size `k`)      | Window size grows/shrinks dynamically           |
| Classic problems: max sum, vowels in k len | Substring/subarray problems with constraints    |
| Usually one pointer loop                   | Needs two pointers to maintain dynamic window   |
