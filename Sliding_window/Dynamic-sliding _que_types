Absolutely! Here's a curated **list of Sliding Window + Map (Dynamic Window) problems**, categorized by **difficulty** and **common patterns** like tracking frequencies, distinct elements, etc. These involve *dynamic window resizing*, making them great for mastering patterns like yours (`Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters`).

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **Easy (Starter Dynamic Window + Map)**

1. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**  
   Leetcode 3  
   ðŸ‘‰ Track frequencies to ensure no char is repeated.  
   *(Map + Set-based variations)*

2. **Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters**  
   Leetcode 159  
   ðŸ‘‰ The one you just did. Classic dynamic window.  

3. **Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters**  
   Leetcode 340  
   ðŸ‘‰ Generalized version of above (K given).

4. **Find All Anagrams in a String**  
   Leetcode 438  
   ðŸ‘‰ Fixed window, but use map to match character counts.

5. **Permutation in String**  
   Leetcode 567  
   ðŸ‘‰ Another fixed-size window + frequency comparison.

### ðŸŸ¡ **Medium (Dynamic + Conditional Logic)**

6. **Minimum Window Substring**  
   Leetcode 76  
   ðŸ‘‰ Maintain target frequency + match count; shrink window optimally.

7. **Longest Repeating Character Replacement**  
   Leetcode 424  
   ðŸ‘‰ Dynamic window, replace at most `k` characters to form repeating substring.

8. **Substrings with Exactly K Distinct Characters**  
   Leetcode 992  
   ðŸ‘‰ Variation of "At Most K" â†’ Use two At Most K counts and subtract.

9. **Fruit Into Baskets**  
   Leetcode 904  
   ðŸ‘‰ Same as "Longest Substring with At Most 2 Distinct Characters", just framed with fruits.

### ðŸ”´ **Hard (Advanced Sliding + Map Logic)**

10. **Substring with Concatenation of All Words**  
    Leetcode 30  
    ðŸ‘‰ Requires checking multiple word matches in a dynamic window.

11. **Minimum Window Subsequence**  
    Leetcode 727  
    ðŸ‘‰ Not pure sliding window, but combines subsequence + window idea.

12. **Count Number of Nice Subarrays**  
    Leetcode 1248  
    ðŸ‘‰ Sliding window for subarrays with exactly K odd numbers (binary sliding idea).

13. **Sliding Window Median**  
    Leetcode 480  
    ðŸ‘‰ Multiset / TreeMap / Heap for maintaining dynamic window median.

| Difficulty | Problem Name                                    | Key Technique                   |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Easy       | Longest Substring Without Repeat                | Map + Set, Dynamic window       |
| Easy       | At Most Two Distinct                            | Map + Size control              |
| Medium     | Minimum Window Substring                        | Map + Match tracking            |
| Medium     | Longest Repeating Replacement                   | Max freq + shrink window        |
| Hard       | Sliding Window Median                           | TreeMap / Heap + Sliding        |
