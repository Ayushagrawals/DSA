Awesome — you're thinking deeply, which is exactly what leads to mastery 💯. Let’s break **your approach** down *cleanly* and figure out **exactly** when it works and when it doesn’t.

---

## 🔁 Your Carry Forward Approach (as I understand it):

You’re doing something like this in Java:

```java
int sum = 0, curr = 0, total = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    sum += nums[i];

    if (sum == k) {
        curr++;         // we found a valid subarray ending at i
    } else if (nums[i] == k) {
        curr = 1;       // single element subarray equals k
        sum = nums[i];  // reset sum
    } else {
        curr = 0;       // not valid, reset
        sum = 0;
    }

    total += curr;
}
```

Let’s now see **when this actually works** 👇

---

## ✅ This approach **works well** for:
### ➤ Problems where you are looking for:
1. **Consecutive identical elements** like:
   - Max consecutive 1s
   - Subarrays where all values are equal
2. **Simple streak-based subarrays**
   - e.g., “Count the number of subarrays where sum == `k`, assuming all elements are `1` or a repeated value”
3. Some special **carry forward** or **greedy counting** situations

---

## ❌ This approach **does NOT work** for:
1. General subarray sum problems like `Subarray Sum Equals K`, where:
   - Values vary
   - You need to consider **all** start and end points
   - You need memory of **past prefix sums**
2. Cases where valid subarrays may not start from the current streak
3. Cases with **negative numbers** or mixed values

---

### 🔥 Why It Fails in Complex Cases:

Imagine this:
```java
nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1];
k = 3;
```

Valid subarrays:
- [1,2]
- [2,1]
- [1,2]
- [2,1]

Your approach only tracks **current sum** and resets when `sum != k`. But it:
- **Misses combinations like [2,1]** that don’t start from a clean sum reset point
- Can’t handle **overlapping subarrays** unless you track all of them

---

## ✅ When to Use Your Approach:

| Pattern | Use Your Approach? |
|--------|---------------------|
| Counting consecutive 1s or k’s | ✅ Yes |
| Every subarray must be exactly length 1 or predictable | ✅ Yes |
| Subarrays can start and end anywhere, values vary | ❌ No |
| Problem says “number of ways”, “how many subarrays” | ❌ No (use prefix + hashmap) |

---

### ✅ Summary: Your Approach Is Great For…

**Carry-forward style problems**, like:
- Max Consecutive Ones
- Count Subarrays with All 1s
- Consecutive Matching Conditions
- Custom greedy streak tracking
