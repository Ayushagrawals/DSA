Perfect! Here's how you should tackle the **4 categories of variable-size sliding window** from **easy → hard**, step-by-step:

---

## ✅ **Recommended Order to Master Variable-Size Sliding Window**

---

### 🟢 **Step 1: Category 1 – Length-Based Problems (Longest / Shortest Subarray)**
- **Why first?** These are easier to visualize. You just expand and shrink the window based on a direct condition (like duplicates, sum, or number of types).
- **Builds your foundation** of how sliding works and when to move `start` and `end`.

🔸 Key Problems (Do in this order):
1. ✅ Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (LC 3)
2. ✅ Fruits Into Baskets (LC 904)
3. ✅ Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters (LC 340)
4. ✅ Longest Repeating Character Replacement (LC 424)
5. ✅ Minimum Size Subarray Sum (LC 209)
6. ✅ Replace Substring for Balanced String (LC 1234)

---

### 🟡 **Step 2: Category 2 – Count of Subarrays that Satisfy a Condition**
- **Why second?** Once you’re comfortable with expanding/shrinking the window, now count how many such windows exist.
- You’ll often use the **"at most K - at most (K-1)"** trick.

🔸 Key Problems:
1. ✅ Count Number of Nice Subarrays (LC 1248)
2. ✅ Subarrays with At Most K Distinct Integers (LC 992)
3. ✅ Subarrays with Exactly K Distinct Integers (LC 992)
4. ✅ Binary Subarrays with Sum (LC 930)
5. ✅ Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters (LC 1358)

---

### 🟠 **Step 3: Category 3 – Max/Min Sum or Product**
- **Why third?** These require **mathematical intuition** (like product logic), plus shrinking the window smartly.
- You’ll practice prefix sums and real-number operations (division, multiplication), which is good prep for harder DS/Algo.

🔸 Key Problems:
1. ✅ Subarray Product Less Than K (LC 713)
2. ✅ Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero (LC 1658)
3. ✅ Maximum Points from Cards (LC 1423)
4. ✅ Maximum Average Subarray I (LC 643)

---

### 🔴 **Step 4: Category 4 – Advanced / Edge Cases**
- **Why last?** These involve very **problem-specific logic** (like keeping vowels in order or balancing counts).
- Once you’re confident with standard patterns, these will make more sense.

🔸 Examples:
1. 🔁 Longest Substring with Same Letters After Replacement (LC 424 – advanced version)
2. 🔁 Longest Substring with All Vowels in Order (LC 1839)
3. 🔁 Longest Ideal Subsequence (LC 2370 – advanced variation)

## 🔚 Final Summary: Do in this order
| Priority | Category | Goal |
|----------|----------|------|
| 🟢 First | Length-Based | Build basic sliding window intuition |
| 🟡 Second | Count-Based | Learn how to **count windows** |
| 🟠 Third | Max/Min Value | Add **prefix sum, product** logic |
| 🔴 Last | Advanced | Handle **edge-cases, custom logic** |
