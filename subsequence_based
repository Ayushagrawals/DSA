Yes ‚Äî all of the above questions fall under **well-defined problem-solving categories**, primarily involving **Subsequences** and often **Dynamic Programming (DP)** or **Hashing**. Here's a breakdown of the core categories and how these problems map to them:

---

### üîπ **1. Subsequence-Based Problems**

These involve choosing elements **in order but not necessarily contiguous**.

| Problem                                                   | Category                          | Key Techniques           |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Longest Fibonacci-like Subsequence (873)                  | Subsequence + Pattern Rule        | HashSet, Brute Force, DP |
| Longest Arithmetic Subsequence (1027)                     | Subsequence + Fixed Difference    | HashMap of diffs + DP    |
| Longest Geometric Subsequence                             | Subsequence + Fixed Ratio         | HashMap of ratios        |
| Longest Increasing Subsequence (300)                      | Subsequence + Strictly Increasing | DP, Binary Search        |
| Longest Bitonic Subsequence                               | Subsequence with Inc ‚Üí Dec        | Two-pass DP (LIS + LDS)  |
| Number of Longest Increasing Subsequences (673)           | Subsequence + Count Variants      | DP                       |
| Count Different Subsequences Forming a Given String (940) | Subsequence + Counting            | DP                       |

### üîπ **2. Continuation Pattern Detection**

Here the focus is on **extending a pattern** ‚Äî like Fibonacci, arithmetic, or matching ‚Äî across a subsequence.

| Problem                            | Pattern                                    | Category                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Longest Fibonacci-like Subsequence | `a + b = c`                                | Fibonacci-like sequence          |
| Longest Arithmetic Subsequence     | `b - a = c - b`                            | Arithmetic progression           |
| Arithmetic Slices (413)            | `arr[i+2] - arr[i+1] == arr[i+1] - arr[i]` | Contiguous Arithmetic (subarray) |
| Longest Geometric Subsequence      | `b / a = c / b`                            | Geometric progression            |

### üîπ **3. DP on Subsequences**

Subsequence problems involving **optimization or counting**, typically solved via **Dynamic Programming**.

| Problem                          | What‚Äôs Optimized  | Key Technique          |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Longest Increasing Subsequence   | Length of LIS     | DP or Binary Search    |
| Number of LIS                    | Count of all LIS  | DP with extra tracking |
| LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) | Match two strings | 2D DP                  |

---

### üîπ **4. Subarray vs Subsequence**

| Type        | Contiguous | Ordered | Example Problems                     |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Subarray    | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ       | Arithmetic Slices (413), Kadane‚Äôs    |
| Subsequence | ‚ùå          | ‚úÖ       | All above (Fibonacci-like, LIS, LCS) |

---

### üîπ TL;DR: Main Categories for Your Reference

1. **Subsequence + DP** ‚Üí LIS, LCS, Fibonacci-like, Arithmetic subsequence
2. **Subsequence + Pattern Rule** ‚Üí Fibonacci / Arithmetic / Geometric
3. **Subsequence + HashMap** ‚Üí For tracking differences or sums efficiently
4. **Contiguous Subarray Problems** (contrast: sliding window, prefix sum, etc.)

Yes ‚Äî **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)** and similar problems fall under the broader category of:

---

### üóÇÔ∏è **Subsequence Dynamic Programming (Subsequence DP)**

#### ‚úÖ Core Category:

**"Dynamic Programming on Subsequences"**

This includes problems where:

* You **don‚Äôt need contiguous elements**.
* You‚Äôre allowed to **skip or delete elements**.
* You're trying to **build the longest (or optimal) valid subsequence**.

### üîß Subcategories Under This:

| Subcategory                         | Problems                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Classic LIS**                     | Longest Increasing Subsequence (Leetcode 300)                 |
| **LIS Variants**                    | Max Sum Increasing Subsequence, Longest Bitonic Subsequence   |
| **Fibonacci-Like**                  | Longest Fibonacci-like Subsequence (Leetcode 873)             |
| **Arithmetic/Geometric**            | Longest Arithmetic Subsequence, Longest Geometric Subsequence |
| **String Subsequence**              | Longest Common Subsequence, Edit Distance                     |
| **Subset/Subsequence Optimization** | 0/1 Knapsack, Partition Equal Subset Sum                      |

### ‚úÖ Summary:

So **LIS** belongs to the **Subsequence DP** family.
If you solve **LIS + Fibonacci-like + Arithmetic Subseq + LCS**, you‚Äôll build a **strong foundation** in this category.
