Yes, there are several classic recursive/backtracking problems that share a similar pattern or mindset to Tower of Hanoi. They often require you to think about breaking down a big problem into smaller subproblems, then combining results. Here are some examples:

### Similar Recursive / Backtracking Problems

1. **N-Queens Problem**

   * Place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
   * You think: place queen in one row, then recurse for next row, backtrack if conflict arises.

2. **Permutations and Combinations**

   * Generate all permutations of a list or string.
   * Recursively swap or pick elements, backtracking after each choice.

3. **Sudoku Solver**

   * Fill a Sudoku grid using recursion and backtracking, trying possible numbers and reverting if no solution.

4. **Subset Sum / Combination Sum**

   * Find all subsets that sum up to a target or combinations of numbers meeting some criteria.

5. **Flood Fill Algorithm (e.g., for coloring an area in graphics)**

   * Recursively fill neighboring cells of the same color.

6. **Balanced Parentheses Generation**

   * Generate all combinations of balanced parentheses using recursive rules.

7. **Robot Grid Paths / Maze Problems**

   * Find paths from start to end recursively, exploring directions and backtracking on dead ends.

8. **Binary Tree Traversals and Recursive Construction**

   * Building or traversing trees recursively.

### What these problems have in common with Tower of Hanoi:

* You solve a smaller subproblem recursively.
* You trust recursive calls to handle details.
* You define base cases clearly.
* You think about the “state” or “configuration” at each step (e.g., board setup, current path).
* You backtrack or combine solutions to form the final answer.

### Should you memorize them?

* It's useful to **understand the pattern** and **practice a few classic recursive problems** like Tower of Hanoi, N-Queens, and subsets.
* Memorizing *exact code* is less important than understanding **how to break problems recursively** and applying that mindset in new problems.
