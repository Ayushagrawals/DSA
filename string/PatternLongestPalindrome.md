Sure! Here are 10 variations of the **longest palindromic substring** problem, each based on different string constraints. These will help you understand how palindromes can be combined with other "good string" properties.

### 1. **Longest Palindromic Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters**
**Problem Statement**:  
Given a string `A` and an integer `K`, return the longest palindromic substring that contains at most `K` distinct characters.

**Example**:
- Input: `A = "aabbc"`, `K = 2`
- Output: `"aabb"`

---

### 2. **Longest Palindromic Substring with No Repeating Characters**
**Problem Statement**:  
Given a string `A`, find the longest palindromic substring that contains no repeating characters.

**Example**:
- Input: `A = "abcba"`
- Output: `"abc"`

---

### 3. **Longest Palindromic Substring of Even Length**
**Problem Statement**:  
Given a string `A`, return the longest palindromic substring with **even length**.

**Example**:
- Input: `A = "abccba"`
- Output: `"abccba"`

---

### 4. **Longest Palindromic Substring of Fixed Length L**
**Problem Statement**:  
Given a string `A` and an integer `L`, find the longest palindromic substring of **exactly length L**.

**Example**:
- Input: `A = "abcba", L = 3`
- Output: `"bcb"`

---

### 5. **Longest Palindromic Substring with Character Frequencies Limited to 2**
**Problem Statement**:  
Given a string `A`, find the longest palindromic substring such that **no character occurs more than twice** in the substring.

**Example**:
- Input: `A = "aabbcc"`
- Output: `"abccba"`

---

### 6. **Longest Palindromic Substring with Odd Length**
**Problem Statement**:  
Given a string `A`, return the longest palindromic substring that has **odd length**.

**Example**:
- Input: `A = "abccba"`
- Output: `"bccb"`

---

### 7. **Longest Palindromic Substring with Exactly One Character Different**
**Problem Statement**:  
Given a string `A`, find the longest palindromic substring that can be transformed into a palindrome by changing **exactly one character**.

**Example**:
- Input: `A = "abcba"`
- Output: `"abca"`

---

### 8. **Longest Palindromic Substring of Fixed Characters**
**Problem Statement**:  
Given a string `A` and a set of allowed characters, return the longest palindromic substring such that all characters in the palindrome belong to the set.

**Example**:
- Input: `A = "aabbcc", allowedChars = {"a", "b"}`
- Output: `"bb"`

---

### 9. **Longest Palindromic Substring with a Fixed Number of Distinct Characters**
**Problem Statement**:  
Given a string `A` and an integer `K`, return the longest palindromic substring that contains **exactly K distinct characters**.

**Example**:
- Input: `A = "abcabc", K = 2`
- Output: `"bcb"`

---

### 10. **Longest Palindromic Substring in a Sliding Window**
**Problem Statement**:  
Given a string `A` and an integer `K`, find the longest palindromic substring in **any substring of length K** from the string.

**Example**:
- Input: `A = "abbccbb", K = 4`
- Output: `"bbcc"`

---

### Summary of the 10 Variations:

1. **Longest Palindrome with At Most K Distinct Characters**
2. **Longest Palindrome with No Repeating Characters**
3. **Longest Palindrome of Even Length**
4. **Longest Palindrome of Fixed Length L**
5. **Longest Palindrome with Character Frequency Limited to 2**
6. **Longest Palindrome with Odd Length**
7. **Longest Palindrome with Exactly One Character Different**
8. **Longest Palindrome with Fixed Characters**
9. **Longest Palindrome with Exactly K Distinct Characters**
10. **Longest Palindrome in a Sliding Window of Length K**

These problems will help you practice finding palindromic substrings while enforcing specific constraints on the string. They cover a range of concepts such as distinct characters, frequency constraints, fixed lengths, sliding windows, and more, while still relying on the core technique of finding palindromes. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any of these!
